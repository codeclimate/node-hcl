HCL
===

Ported from https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl

HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language built by HashiCorp. The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language that is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.

HCL is also fully JSON compatible. That is, JSON can be used as completely valid input to a system expecting HCL. This helps makes systems interoperable with other systems.

HCL is heavily inspired by libucl, nginx configuration, and others similar.

Syntax
------

The complete grammar can be found here, if you're more comfortable reading specifics, but a high-level overview of the syntax and grammar are listed here.

-	Single line comments start with # or //

-	Multi-line comments are wrapped in /* and */

-	Values are assigned with the syntax key = value (whitespace doesn't matter). The value can be any primitive: a string, number, boolean, object, or list.

-	Strings are double-quoted and can contain any UTF-8 characters. Example: "Hello, World"

-	Numbers are assumed to be base 10. If you prefix a number with 0x, it is treated as a hexadecimal. If it is prefixed with 0, it is treated as an octal. Numbers can be in scientific notation: "1e10".

-	Boolean values: true, false, on, off, yes, no.

-	Arrays can be made by wrapping it in []. Example: ["foo", "bar", 42]. Arrays can contain primitives and other arrays, but cannot contain objects. Objects must use the block syntax shown below.

-	Objects and nested objects are created using the structure shown below:

```go
variable "ami" {
    description = "the AMI to use"
}
```

```json
{
  variable: {
    "ami": {
      description: "the AMI to use"
    }
  }
}

```

TODO
----

-	[] Parse HCL from string into JSON
-	[] Parse HCL from file into JSON
-	[] Requireable config from HCL
-	[] JSON to HCL string
-	[] JSON to HCL file
-	[] Handle variables
-	[] Handle templates
-	[] Add built-in functions [like here](https://terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html)
-	[] Handle custom interpreters [like here](https://terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html)
